A Look into Successful Congressional Bills
==========================================

Design Studio 3 - Peer Feedback
-------------------------------

Feedback received from: Mychal Ceruti (mceruti@g.harvard.edu)

<b>A Brief Summary about our Project:</b><br>
In our Final Project, we are attempting to implement a visualization that will make understanding
and learning about Congressional Bills easier. Information regarding said bills is available
online but there isn't any analytic visualization that shows which House contributed to what bill.
Hence, in our visualization, we are establishing three views to display such information. 

The first view, an overview visual, will display a bar graph that shows approximately 30 classifications 
(a category to which a bill belongs) and show how many bills passed and which House was responsible.
This view will help show viewers what each House is interested in and what classification receives the
most attention. For example, if the House of Republican is responsible for 30 bills being passed in 
Transportation and Public Works, which is the classification with most bills passed, we know that the
main focus of Republicans is for said classification and that this is viewed as the most important.

The second and third view will show more details about each individual bill. The second view will be
a table of force layouts (as previously done in homework assignment) where each cell will have a force
layout for each classification. Each node per force layout will represent a bill. A user will have the
ability to scroll over a node and have a tooltip with the bill name and the responsible house appear.
Now, if a user clicks on a node, the third view will trigger to the right. The third view is a even 
more detailed view of the clicked bill. It will present information about the bill and what the bill 
does.

Through these three visualizations, users will be able to understand in more depth about the passed
Congressional Bills.


<b>Feedback:</b><br>
During our discussions about my groups Final Project, Mychal made some very useful comments.
One of the most critical remarks made regarded adding some features to our first view, the
overview visual. The first suggestion that Mychal made was to add radio buttons that when clicked
will transition the bars from least bills to most bills passed. This will allow users to view
classifications in regards to the most important and least important with ease. Another suggestion,
a more challenging idea, is to add a radio button that when clicked will separate the bar graph 
per House. This way, the user can clearly distinguish the number of bills passed per House and
see where the interests of each House lie. For example the House of Republicans may make majority
of their contribution to Transportation and Public Works while the House of Democrats may make
majority of their contribution to Health. This helps see the interests of each House.

As a group, in future revisions, we believe that adding radio buttons to transition the bars from least passed bills
to most passed bills is a great idea and we will implement it into our project. The second idea to separate
the visual by house, in essence have a bar graph for each House, is a great idea but a little more
challenging to implement as a transformation from our overview visual bar graph. Rather, if time permits,
we will implement this as a separate view and allow the users to click a radio button to show this view. 

Some other feedback from Mychal was that our project was really innovative and interesting. As a citizen
it is important for one to know which bills are passed and where a House's interest lies. A minor
recommendation was to change the color and size of the node in the second view in accordance to the
House color and whichever House was responsible, have those nodes be a little larger than the other
nodes in that classification. This would help have a clear distinction for which bills were passed
by whom. In future revision, we will definitely implement this. Also, Mychal really liked our idea 
to use the colors red and blue to represent the Houses. These colors are easy to distinguish and 
match each House's color.

Overall, having this feedback was really helpful and encouraging. It gave us the feedback and perspective
from potential users and what sort of information they would expect to see. Mychal gave constructive feedback
which was helpful in making our project better.
