A Look into Successful Congressional Bills
==========================================

Design Studio 3 - Peer Feedback
-------------------------------

Feedback received from: Mychal Ceruti (mceruti@g.harvard.edu)

<b>A Brief Summary about our Project:</b>
In our Final Project, we are attempting to implement a visualization that will make understanding
and learning about Congressional Bills easier. Information regarding said bills is available
online but there isn't any analytic visualization that shows which House contributed to what bill.
Hence, in our visualization, we are establishing three views to display such information. 

The first view, an overview view, will display a bar graph that shows approximately 30 classifications 
(a category to which a bill belongs) and show how many bills passed and which House was responsible.
This view will help show viewers what each House is interested in and what classification receives the
most attention. For example, if the House of Republican is responsible for 30 bills being passed in 
Transportation and Public Works, which is the classification with most bills passed, we know that the
main focus of Republicans is for said classification and that this is viewed as the most important.

The second and third view will show more details about each individual bill. The second view will be
a table of force layouts (as previously done in homework assignment) where each cell will have a force
layout for each classification. Each node per force layout will represent a bill. A user will have the ability
to scroll over a node and have a tooltip with the bill name and the responsible house appear. Now, if a user
clicks on a node, the third view will trigger. The third view is a even more detailed view of the clicked bill.
It will present information about the bill and what the bill does.

Through these three visualizations, users will be able to understand in more depth about the passed
Congressional Bills.
